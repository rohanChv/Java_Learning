Hello ! I have started Learning Java.(Again ...)
First we are learning about the Data Types
We need the primitive data types to Store the data as per the type of variable. This is needed as Java is strongly typed Language
there are 8 primitive types of data

Integer Type =>
byte :Byte width is 8 bits.Example is 2
short :short width is 16 bits/2 bytes.Example is 2
int :int represents integer Data type with width 32 bit/4 bytes.Example 32
long : long represents integer data with 64 bit length. prefix L is added to specify that the number is of type long . Example 2304102932483498

Floating Point Data types =>
float :Float has length of 32 bits.f prefix is added to specify it's a floating point data.Default is double.Example :23.343
double :double is 64 bit . provides more floating point numbers. Example :2342903.9345734995

other DataTypes =>
boolean :single bit true/false.Example :false
char :character datatype 16 bit value .:Example :L
